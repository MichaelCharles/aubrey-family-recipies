# Ingredients

## Crust

- 3/4 cup granola (with no raisins or dried fruit)
- 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons sugar

## Baked Layer

- 1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1/2 cup fresh Key lime juice
- 3 egg yolks

## Chilled Layer

- 1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese, room temperature
- 1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1/4 cup fresh Key lime juice
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

# Directions

## For the Crust

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Using on/off turns, blend granola in food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer granola to medium bowl. Mix in graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Press crumb mixture over bottom and up sides of 9-inch diameter deep-dish glass pie dish. Bake until crust is golden brown, about 8 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F.

Remove crust from oven and cool completely.

## For the Baked Layer

Whisk condensed milk, lime juice, and egg yolks to blend. Pour into cooled pie crust. Bake until custard is set, about 25 minutes. Cool to room temperature.

## For the Chilled Layer

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese, condensed milk, lime juice, sugar, and vanilla extract in large bowl. Pour over cooled baked layer; smooth top. Cover and chill until firm, at least 4 hours.
