# Ingredients

- 1 head of cabbage (medium to large)
- 1-2 medium sized carrots
- 1/2 jar of Miracle Whip
- 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice
- 1/4 cup of warm water
- Box grater for cabbage & carrots
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- Optional: 1/8 piece of onion and 1/8 piece of bell pepper

# Directions

Mix together Miracle Whip, water, lemon juice, and sugar. Mix until the dressing is the desired consistency and the sugar is dissolved. Fine-tune to your desired sweetness and thickness.

Grate cabbage and carrots into large bowl (this would be the time to add the optional ingredients).

Mix cabbage, carrots, and the dressing together and put into the refrigerator to let the ingredients marry; 1-2 hours, maybe longer.
